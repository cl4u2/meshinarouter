Mesh in a router
----------------

This script emulates an (OLSR) network in a Linux-based (e.g. OpenWRT/LEDE)
router. The router's kernel must have the Linux network namespaces enabled,
and the system must have installed full blown iproute2, bash and olsrd.

Please note that the script can be potentially used on any Linux-based system
(it doesn't have to be a router).
